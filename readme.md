# Code Review #2: What Kind of Cat Are You?

#### Code Review #1 for Epicodus, 02-24-2019

#### By **Alicia Toshima**

## Description

This project is an HTML form that asks users to input answers into a form (Buzzfeed-esque quiz) and will return what kind of cat they are. Link to GitHub pages can be found here: https://aliciatoshima.github.io/portfolio/. It features an image of Alicia's roommate's cat (Nemo) and a series of questions. This project is an exercise in using HTML (and showcasing all of the elements learned), CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and jquery, and demonstrating proper indentation and spacing (hopefully).

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository onto your machine into the location of your choice.
`git clone https://github.com/aliciatoshima/Buzzfeed.git`
* Open the Buzzfeed folder in the text editor of your choice
* Open index.html file.

## Known Bugs

* I had a little trouble with using regex for my logic so it's not really as defined or accurate as I would like it to be. I wanted to based the logic of "You chose mostly a's, so you got this answer", but it was quite challenging so I would like to hear your solution for this.
* Another issue that I had was that every time the submit button was hit, another image would be appended to the previous image. I though using `.last()` would solve the problem of maybe `.empty()`, but I wasn't able to figure it out
